# Reddit Video Maker Bot üé•
- THIS FORK IS NOT INTENDED FOR CONTRIBUTING TO UPSTREAM, THESE ARE MY MODIFICATIONS AND PROBABLY WON'T WORK FOR ANYONE ELSE
- Make sure you're on windows, I'll remove any and everything not Windows related in this fork.
- You need to keep clicking retry on the reddit site in the screenshot phase or it will timeout playwright.

# Todo - 
- make it read the post like for r/aita, config for that
- remove unnecessary tts crap and just use googlertranslte or pyttsx with male heavy voice
